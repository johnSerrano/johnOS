A super simple operating system by John Serrano

//can you even call it an operating system?



Written for fun. I really had no idea what I was getting into here... It's not functional in really any sense of the word, but I learned a lot writing this. At the moment, it is too simple to have any application.




to run:

make run

*requires qemu




State of Development:

+ Boots into 32bit protected mode
+ Executes C programs
+ Screen Driver works for command line purposes at fixed resolution (80x25)
- Keyboard driver reads from keyboard and can translate some characters but does not cover all keys
- Cannot current process commands into programs
